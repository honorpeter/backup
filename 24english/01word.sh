Inventors have long dreamed of creating machines that think.

AI is a thriving field with many practical applications and active research
    topics.

This book is about a solution to these more intuitive problem.

One of the key challenges in AI is how to get this informal knowledge into 
    a computer.
        informal formal formula

Of course, it can be difficult to extract such high-level, abstract features
        from raw data.








In the early days of artificial intelligence, 

The introduction of deep learning to speech recognition resulted in a sudden
    drop of error rates by up to half!


We expect deep learning to appear in more and more scientific
        fields in the future. 

In summary,
In the subsequent parts of the book
